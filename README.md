# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using Python! This is a command-line version of the game that can be played between two players. The game will prompt the players to take turns marking their respective spots on the board until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

## How to Play

The game is played on a 3x3 grid where each player takes turns to mark one of the available positions with their marker ('X' or 'O'). The first player to place three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

If all 9 spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Game Features

- **Two-player Mode**: The game is designed for two players, with 'Player 1' and 'Player 2' alternating turns.
- **Random Player Selection**: At the start of the game, a coin toss (random selection) determines which player goes first.
- **Input Validation**: The game ensures that players can only choose valid positions on the board that are not already taken.
- **Winning Check**: The game automatically checks for a winner after every move. If a player gets three in a row, the game declares them the winner.
- **Tie Check**: If all the positions are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
- **Replay Option**: After each game, players have the option to play again.
